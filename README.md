# 🛡️ OSI 1–7 Defense-in-Depth Security Blueprint

## Objective
Design and validate a layered security posture for a single-user workstation and home network using the OSI model as a control-mapping framework.

**Why this matters**
Most security failures occur due to single-layer assumptions. This project demonstrates how layered controls reduce blast radius, improve detection, and enforce least privilege across hardware, network, system, and user layers.

### Threat Model (High Level)

-  Credential compromise

-  Device loss or theft

-  Malicious downloads / phishing

-  Network interception

-  Data exfiltration
