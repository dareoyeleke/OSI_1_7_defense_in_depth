 Cybersecurity & Defense-in-Depth Project

Independent Security Implementation | Remote | 2024 – Present

Key Tools & Technologies: BitLocker, TPM, Tailscale, Windows Defender, PGP/SMIME, Google Cloud DLP, Python, VS Code, BitDefender 

Highlights:

Designed and implemented a multi-layered security framework across OSI layers 1–7, incorporating network, endpoint, and application security controls.

Configured full disk encryption on internal and external drives using BitLocker, TPM, and high-complexity PINs, ensuring secure storage of sensitive data.

Secured multi-device network using Tailscale VPN, enabling encrypted communication across phone, tablet, and desktop with MagicDNS, HTTPS certificates, and restricted LAN access.

Implemented Windows Defender policies including firewall rules, scheduled scans, and automated logout for public/private/domain networks.

Applied email encryption protocols (PGP via FlowCrypt and S/MIME via Atcalis) with RSA 4096-bit keys for end-to-end protection.

Developed Data Loss Prevention scripts in Python to scan for PII and sensitive data, alerting for potential breaches in datasets and code repositories.

Managed key lifecycle, certificate management, and secure storage for all encryption and authentication assets.

Implemented MDM security controls to prevent social engineering through spam messages, calls, App Lock and Antitheft controls.
