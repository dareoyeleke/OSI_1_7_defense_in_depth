# 🧱 Pre-OSI / Firmware Security

## Focus
Trusted system startup and firmware integrity.

## Controls Implemented
- UEFI / BIOS security configurations
- CPU microcode protections
- Firmware-level trust enforcement

## Risks Addressed
- Firmware persistence
- Rootkit-style compromises
- Attacks before OS initialization

## Outcome
Provides a secure foundation upon which all higher-layer controls depend.

# 🔌 Layer 1 – Physical

## Focus
Hardware root-of-trust and device integrity.

## Controls Implemented

### Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
- Hardware-backed key storage
- Secure cryptographic operations

### Secure Boot
- Boot chain integrity verification
- Prevents unauthorized firmware or OS loaders

## Risks Addressed
- Device theft
- Boot-level tampering
- Offline attacks against storage

## Outcome
Establishes trust at the hardware level before OS execution.


# ⚙️ Layer 2 – Data Link

## Focus
Local network exposure reduction.

## Controls Implemented

### Encrypted Overlay Networking
- All meaningful traffic encapsulated via Tailscale VPN
- Prevents reliance on trusted LAN assumptions

## Risks Addressed
- Local network sniffing
- Man-in-the-middle attacks on shared networks

## Notes
Direct Layer 2 controls are minimized due to encrypted overlay architecture.



# 🌐 Layers 3–4 – Network & Transport

## Focus
Secure data transport and network traffic control.

## Controls Implemented

### Windows Defender Firewall
- Inbound and outbound traffic filtering
- Rule-based network segmentation

### Tailscale (WireGuard)
- Encrypted transport-layer communication
- Secure routing over public networks

## Risks Addressed
- Network interception
- Unauthorized inbound connections
- Lateral movement

## Outcome
Reduces attack surface at the network and transport layers.


# 🌐 Layer 5 – Session

## Focus
Secure session establishment, persistence, and encryption.

## Controls Implemented

### Tailscale (WireGuard VPN)
- Encrypted device-to-device sessions
- Identity-based networking

### Encrypted DNS
- DNS over HTTPS (DoH)
- DNS over TLS (DoT)
- Prevents DNS interception and profiling

## Risks Addressed
- Session hijacking
- DNS spoofing
- Traffic inspection on untrusted networks

## Outcome
Maintains session confidentiality and integrity across networks.


# 🔐 Layer 6 – Presentation

## Focus
Data confidentiality, integrity, and cryptographic protection.

## Controls Implemented

### BitLocker
- Full disk encryption for data-at-rest
- TPM-backed key storage

### FlowCrypt (PGP)
- End-to-end email encryption
- Protects message content in transit and at rest

### S/MIME
- Certificate-based email encryption
- Digital signing for message authenticity

## Risks Addressed
- Unauthorized access to stored data
- Email interception or tampering
- Loss of confidentiality during data exchange

## Outcome
Ensures data remains protected regardless of transport or storage medium.


# 🧠 Layer 7 – Application

## Focus
Application-level data protection, malware prevention, and user-facing security controls.

## Controls Implemented

### Google Cloud DLP
- Regex-based content inspection using `re` and `os` modules
- Detection of sensitive data patterns (PII) in files and scripts
- Used as a lightweight Data Loss Prevention (DLP) mechanism

### Microsoft Defender
- Real-time malware detection
- Scheduled scans and signature updates
- Application-level threat prevention

### Secure Email Clients
- Thunderbird as primary email client
- Integrated encryption tools for secure communication

## Risks Addressed
- Malware execution
- Accidental or malicious data leakage
- Phishing and unsafe email content

## Outcome
Provides first-line defense where users directly interact with data and applications.
