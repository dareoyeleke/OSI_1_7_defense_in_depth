## Focus
Secure session establishment, persistence, and encryption.

## Controls Implemented

### Tailscale (WireGuard VPN)

- Identity-based networking

### Encrypted DNS
- DNS over HTTPS (DoH)
- DNS over TLS (DoT)
- Prevents DNS interception and profiling

## Risks Addressed
- Session hijacking
- DNS spoofing
- Traffic inspection on untrusted networks

## Outcome
