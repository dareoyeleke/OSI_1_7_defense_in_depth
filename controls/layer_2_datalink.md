# ⚙️ Layer 2 – Data Link

## Focus
Local network exposure reduction.

## Controls Implemented

### Encrypted Overlay Networking
- All meaningful traffic encapsulated via Tailscale VPN
- Prevents reliance on trusted LAN assumptions

## Risks Addressed
- Local network sniffing
- Man-in-the-middle attacks on shared networks

## Notes
Direct Layer 2 controls are minimized due to encrypted overlay architecture.
